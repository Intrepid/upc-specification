\subsection{UPC Non-Blocking Transfer Operations \nbheader}
\label{upc-nb}
\index{\_\_UPC\_NB\_\_}

\npf Implementations that support this interface shall predefine the
feature macro {\tt \_\_UPC\_NB\_\_} to the value 1.

\subsubsection{Standard header}
\index{upc\_nb.h}

\np The standard header is

\nbheader

\np Unless otherwise noted, all of the functions, types and macros
    specified in Section~\ref{upc-nb}
    are declared by the header \nbheader.

\subsubsection{Common Requirements}
\label{upc-nb-common}

\np The following requirements apply to all of the functions defined
in Section~\ref{upc-nb}.

\np This section defines extensions to the \memstar functions defined in
[UPC Language Specifications, Section 7.2.5]. Data transfer effects are
as specified in that document.

\np \nbheader defines two non-blocking variants for each \memstar function.
The {\tt \_nb} function name suffix denotes the {\em explicit-handle} variant, 
whereas the {\tt \_nbi} function name suffix denotes the {\em implicit-handle} variant.
These functions are jointly referred to as {\em \TIFs}. 
A thread which invokes one of these functions is referred to
as the {\em initiating thread} for the transfer.

\np A \TIF returns as soon as possible after
initiating the transfer and may return prior to the effects of the transfer being
completed.~\footnote{
Each call to a \TIF shall either initiate an asynchronous transfer or
perform the transfer synchronously within the initiation call 
(and return \complete in the case of an explicit-handle initiation).
The conditions governing this decision are unspecified.
For example, an implementation might choose to
perform a synchronous transfer when all affected memory has affinity to the initiating thread.
Implementations are encouraged to perform asynchronous transfers and
return quickly whenever possible to allow the caller to overlap unrelated 
computation and communication.
}
Generally the initiating thread must later take explicit action to 
synchronize the completion of the transfer.

\np The explicit-handle variant returns a handle that gives the initiating thread explicit
control and responsibility to manage completion of the transfer.  
The initiating thread shall eventually invoke a successful \sync function call
upon each such handle, to synchronize completion of the associated transfer
and allow the implementation to reclaim resources that may be associated with the handle.

\np The implicit-handle variant allows the program to synchronize
completion of an implicit group of transfers together, at the next call to \synci
by the initiating thread.

\np Each call entry to a \TIF defines the beginning of an abstract interval referred to 
as the {\em transfer interval} for the transfer operation being performed. 
The {\em transfer interval} extends until the return of the successful \sync or \synci call
which synchronizes the completion of the transfer.

\np Each non-blocking transfer proceeds independently of all other operations and actions
by any thread until the end of the transfer interval. In particular, the transfer 
interval may extend beyond strict operations and other forms of inter-thread synchronization.

\np The order in which non-blocking transfers complete is unspecified - the implementation may
coalesce and/or reorder non-blocking operations with respect to other blocking or non-blocking operations,
or operations initiated from a separate thread. The only ordering guarantees are those
explicitly enforced using the synchronization functions, i.e. all the accesses comprising the 
transfer are guaranteed to occur during the transfer interval.

\np Throughout the transfer interval, the contents of all destination memory specified by the 
transfer are undefined. Specifically, concurrent reads to these locations from any
thread will observe an indeterminate value.

\np If any of the source or destination memory specified by a transfer is modified by any thread
during the transfer interval, then the results of the transfer are undefined. Specifically, 
concurrent writes to these locations will result in indeterminate values in the destination
memory which persist after synchronization.

\np The source memory specified in a transfer is not modified by the transfer.
Concurrent reads of source memory areas by any thread are permitted and behave as usual.
Multiple concurrent transfers initiated by any thread are permitted to specify overlapping source memory areas.
If a transfer specifies destination memory which overlaps its own source, or the source or destination of a 
concurrent transfer initiated by any thread, the resulting values in all destination memory specified
by the affected transfers are indeterminate.

\np The memory consistency semantics of all transfers performed by the library are as described in 
[UPC Language Specifications, Section B.3.2.1]. Specifically, the effect on
conflicting accesses issued {\em outside} the transfer interval is as if the transfer were
performed by a set of relaxed shared reads and relaxed shared writes of
unspecified size and order, issued at unspecified times anywhere within the transfer
interval by the initiating thread. Conflicting accesses {\em inside} the transfer interval
have undefined results, as specified in the preceding paragraphs.~%
\footnote{The restrictions described in the three preceding paragraphs are a direct consequence of 
[UPC Language Specifications, Section B.3.2.1], and also apply to the blocking \memstar functions.
They are explicitly stated here for clarity.}
Here {\em inside} and {\em outside} are defined by the {\tt Precedes()} program order for 
accesses issued by the initiating thread; accesses issued by other threads are considered {\em inside} 
unless every possible and valid $<_{strict}$ relationship orders them outside the transfer interval.~%
\footnote{
Stated differently, a successful \sync or \synci call completes transfers with respect 
to the initiating thread, and subsequent relaxed accesses issued by the initiating thread
are guaranteed to observe the effects of the synchronized transfer(s).

Similarly, a successful \sync or \synci call followed by a strict operation 
ensures the effects of the synchronized transfer(s) will be observed by all 
threads prior to observing the strict operation.  
}

\subsubsection{Explicit Handle Type}
\index{upc\_handle\_t}
\index{UPC\_COMPLETE\_HANDLE}
\npf An implementation shall define the following type and value:

\begin{verbatim}
type  upc_handle_t
value UPC_COMPLETE_HANDLE
\end{verbatim}

\np \complete shall have type {\tt upc\_handle\_t}.  All of its bits shall be 0.

\np Any handle value other than \complete is valid only for the initiating thread which 
obtained it from an explicit-handle \TIF.
Different threads shall not use it for any purpose.

\np Every handle value returned from an explicit-handle \TIF call shall eventually be passed to
a successful \sync call.  It is an error to discard a handle value and never
synchronize it unless the value is \complete. 

\np Once a handle value is successfully synchronized, it becomes invalid and shall not be
used for any purpose.

                            size_t n );
\end{verbatim}

{\bf Description}

\np The transfer initiated by \func\args shall have the same effects as \sfunc\args.
If the returned value is \complete, then these effects were performed synchronously
and the transfer is complete. Otherwise, the transfer interval extends until
the return of a successful \sync call upon the returned handle.

\np All of the common requirements listed in Section~\ref{upc-nb-common} apply to this function.

\np The following two code sequences demonstrate the relationship between
\sfunc and \func. Both transfers ultimately result in the same data movement.

upc_memcpy( dst, src, n ); // perform an explicitly synchronous transfer
...  // code that may access dst and src regions
