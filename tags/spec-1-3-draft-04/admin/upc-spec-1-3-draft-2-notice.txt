UPC Language Specification (version 1.3)

Draft 2 Release Notice

Date: September 22, 2012

Background
----------

During the course of the past few months, a group of UPC compiler
vendors, users, and programming language experts (known as the
UPC Consortium) has formed for the purpose of updating the
UPC (Unified Parallel C) language specification.

The current UPC language specification (version 1.2) was ratified
several years ago (2005).  The recent effort to update the
UPC language specification intends to incorporate both compiler
development experience and user experience to improve the precision
of the current standard and to define new library capabilities
that provide facilities which are often required when implementing
parallel programming solutions in UPC.

UPC Specification Version 1.3 Draft 2
-------------------------------------

This document is a draft and has not been ratified by the UPC
consortium.  All contents should be considered speculative and subject
to change.  Change annotations appearing in this draft are relative to
the baseline Version 1.3 Draft 1, which is believed to be semantically
identical in every detail to UPC language specification version 1.2
(ratified May 2005). Change annotations in the specification body
are for reviewer convenience only and are not normative, nor will
they appear in the final draft.

Draft 2 Change Summary
----------------------

This Draft 2 of the UPC language specification addresses
the following issues:

Issue  #4: Progress guarantee of upc_notify and upc_wait

Issue  #9: Library: High-Performance Wall-Clock Timers (upc_tick_t)
           (This timer library was added as a required library.)

Issue #32: modification: THREADS/MYTHREAD have "integral value"
           rather than "type int"

Issue #33: clarification: MYTHREAD and THREADS are expressions
           (cannot assign to or take address of them)

Issue #49: clarification: unlock of freed lock

           in barrier matching semantics

Issue #83: Strengthen the "default" pragma from "implementation-defined"
