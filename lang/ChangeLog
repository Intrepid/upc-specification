	refers to the generated .html_dir directory.
	* upc-lang-spec.tex: Clean up escaped line endings.
	Re-instate a commented out \addcontentsline directive.

	* Makefile: Add definitions for $(RMDIR) and $(CLEAN_FILES)

	Implement changes to further support HTML generation.
	* upc-specs-1-2.tex:  Add markup and test for HTML generation.

	(npf): First occurrences in sections of \np replaced by \npf
	"number paragraph first" directives throughout.
	* latex2html: Add improved error diagnostic that is issued
	when an unmatched HTML tag is encountered.  This is not
	strictly necessary, but does help debug problems with generated HTML.

	both HTML and PDF versions of the UPC language specification.
	* upc-specs-1-2.tex: Renamed from upc_specs_1.2.tex.

	* latex2html.cfg.pl: New. Symlink to .latex2html-init to
