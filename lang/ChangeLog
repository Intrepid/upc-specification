	* Makefile: Add definitions for $(RMDIR) and $(CLEAN_FILES)
	to fully implement the 'clean' target.  This works around some
	shortcomings in the latex-mk Makefile template.

	Implement changes to further support HTML generation.
	* upc-specs-1-2.tex:  Add markup and test for HTML generation.
	Replace use of math markup such as $i$ with {\tt i}
	to improve HTML readability and to simplify LaTeX usage.
	Miscellaneous corrections and improvements.
	(tab): New command to generate an approximate tab in the
	HTML output.
	(np): Modify new paragraph command to add tab character after
	paragraph number in HTML output.
	(sterm, ssterm, pterm): New commands to specify section, sub-section,
	and paragraph level terms.  Used to replace use of explicit section
	numbering and index tagging.
	(npf): First occurrences in sections of \np replaced by \npf
	"number paragraph first" directives throughout.
	* latex2html: Add improved error diagnostic that is issued
	when an unmatched HTML tag is encountered.  This is not
	strictly necessary, but does help debug problems with generated HTML.

	both HTML and PDF versions of the UPC language specification.
	* upc-specs-1-2.tex: Renamed from upc_specs_1.2.tex.

	* latex2html.cfg.pl: New. Symlink to .latex2html-init to

	* latex2html: New. local copy of the latex2html script.
	* README.txt: New. Describe files in this directory.
