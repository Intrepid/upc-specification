#summary UPC specification procedural guidelines

= Introduction =

We define the procedures that will be followed during the UPC standardization process.  This process is intended to be inclusive within the UPC community and driven by consensus.  These guidelines are not meant to contravene the UPC Specification 1.2 description a process largely designed for new libraries.  Instead it is to be used for changes to the specification that are more granular in scope.

= Membership =

Anyone who wishes may participate in the standardization process.  No official membership is required to submit proposed modifications or to participate in the standardization process.

= Making Changes to the Standard =

The following process will be used to review proposed changes to the UPC standard:

 # A formal proposal that identifies all changes to the specification must be made publicly accessible through the UPC specification website.
 # An email announcement must be made to the UPC specification group.
 # Following the announcement of the formal proposal, a one monty public comment period will be observed.
 # Following the two week public comment period, a specification group meeting will be held to discuss the proposal and community feedback.

If consensus is reached at the end of this process, the proposal will be accepted in the standard.  If consensus is not reached, the process must be restarted.
