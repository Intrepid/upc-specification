UPC Language Specification (version 1.3) - Draft 1 Release Notice

Date: August 25, 2012

Background
----------

During the course of the past few months, a group of UPC compiler
vendors, users, and programming language experts (known as the
UPC Consortium) has formed for the purpose of updating the
UPC (Unified Parallel C) language specification.

The current UPC language specification (version 1.2) was ratified
several years ago (2005).  The recent effort to update the
UPC language specification intends to incorporate both compiler
development experience and user experience to improve the precision
of the current standard and to define new library capabilities
that provide facilities which are often required when implementing
parallel programming solutions in UPC.

UPC Specification Version 1.3 Draft 1
-------------------------------------

This draft of the specification reflects a high-level
reorganization of the UPC specification into three separate
documents: the main language and core library specification,
the required libraries specification, and the optional libraries
specification.  The versioning and release of these documents
will become decoupled starting with the ratification of the 1.3
specification.  This draft is otherwise believed to be semantically
identical in every detail to UPC language specification version 1.2
(ratified May 2005), and will serve as the baseline for change
comparison in future drafts.
