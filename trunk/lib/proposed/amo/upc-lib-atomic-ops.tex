\npf This subsection provides the UPC parallel extensions of [ISO/IEC00 
    Sec 7.19].  All the characteristics of library functions described
    in [ISO/IEC00 Sec 7.1.4] apply to these as well.  Implementations
    that support this interface shall predefine the feature macro {\tt
    \_\_UPC\_ATOMIC\_\_} to the value 1.
