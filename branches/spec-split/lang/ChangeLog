2012-03-14  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-lib-extensions.tex: New. Extract library extensions
	guidelines from the core library document, into its own file.

2012-03-14  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	Move these files back into the 'lang' directory.
	* upc-acknowledgments.tex: Move from ../common.
	* upc-introduction.tex: Ditto.
	* upc-lib-mem-semantics.tex: Ditto.
	* upc-references.tex: Ditto.

	* upc-lang-spec.tex: Bump rev. number to 1.3 and 
	revision date to March 9, 2012
	* upc-lib-core.tex: Move from ../lib/core

	Preliminary split of UPC Specification into language
	and library parts.
	* check_l2h_cfg: Move to ../common.
	* latex2html.cfg: Ditto.
	* README.txt: Adjust for file changes.
	* Makefile: Adjust for file name changes and move of files to
	the ../common directory.
	* upc-language.tex: New. Extract the UPC language specification
	main description from the specification document.
	* upc-lang-spec.tex: Include the various sub-parts of the
	specification that were extracted from the previous
	monolithic document.
	* upc-mem-consistency-model.tex: New. Extract the memory consistency
	model description from the specification document.
	* upc-vs-c-std-section-nums.tex: New. Extract the UPC to C standard
	section mapping description from the specification document.

2011-11-08  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-lang-spec.tex(sterm, ssterm, pterm): Adjust definition
	and use of the term/definition related macros, to address
	issue #1.  To avoid the introduction of an extra space at
	the beginning of the definition, it is necessary to end
	each introducing term macro invocation with a %-sign.

2011-11-07  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	* Makefile: Only build the HTML formatted specification if
	BUILD_HTML is asserted.  When building HTML, first invoke
	`check_l2h_cfg' to verify that the installed latex2html
	tool paths are valid.
	* check_l2h_cfg: Find latex2html via environment variable
	or use default location.  Print the location of the installed
	l2hconf.pm configuration package.
	* README.txt: Document the BUILD_HTML make variable.

2011-11-07  Bill Carlson  <wwc@uuuuc.us>

	* upc-lang-spec.tex: Adjusted tocdepth to 3 to match current spec
	and ansi-iso c99.

2011-11-06  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-lang-spec.tex: Fix typos.

2011-11-06  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	* check_l2h_cfg: New. Script that checks for latex2html config. errors.
	* latex2html: Delete.  The small modifications made to this script
	weren't worth the complications of potential installation
	configuration differences.
	* README.txt: Document check_l2h_cfg and remove latex2html description.
	* Makefile: Re-instate LATEX2HTML_FLAGS.  Remove latex2html from
	the "dist files" list.  Add check_l2h_cfg to the "dist files" list.

2011-11-06  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-lnag-spec.tex: Use titlesec package to
	redefine paragraph level heading to behave like
	subsection.  Use this to auto-number section 3 (Terms)
	and to remove "\ \\" idiom previously used after \paregraph{}.
	Move \usepackage{html} before \usepackege{hyperref} per
	html package recommendation.  This necessitates moving
	the bookmark and other hyperref options into the initial
	\documentclass directive.
	(tab): fix \texttt{} typo.
	(sterm,ssterm,pterm): Remove implicit \npf to avoid introduction
	of extra space character after macro invocation.  Adjust references
	to these macros so that they explicitly invoke \npf.  This also
	makes the formatting of those term entries more uniform with other
	sections in the document.
	(Terms section): Temporarily set TOC level to 1, so that the terms
	do not appear in the TOC.

2011-11-05  Bill Carlson  <wwc@uuuuc.us>

	Remove reference to "local" latex2html, now works (for me) with
	default install for latex2html-2008.
	* Makefile: comment out reference to latex2html.cfg
	
	Typesetting tweaks
	* upc-lang-spec.tex: More-or-less fix typesetting of section 3.
	This has always used some fairly crufty stuff to achieve the
	desired effects.  There is probably a more elegant way to do this,
	but it seems to work fairly well
	
2011-11-04  Bill Carlson  <wwc@uuuuc.us>

	* README.txt: How to setup tex environment

2011-11-03  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	Simplify the latex2html make infrastructure.
	* latex2html.cfg: Rename from .latex2html-init.
	* README.txt: Delete reference to latex2html.cfg.pl
	and adjust for latex2html.cfg.
	* latex2html.cfg.pl: Delete symlink.
	* Makefile (LATEX2HTML_FLAGS): New.  Specify -init
	switch to refer to latex2html.cfg.  Adjust the "extra dist"
	file list to reflect changes above.

2011-11-03  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	* Makefile: Fix clean-html make target so that it correctly
	refers to the generated .html_dir directory.
	* upc-lang-spec.tex: Clean up escaped line endings.
	Re-instate a commented out \addcontentsline directive.
	Delete let/def that dealt with the TOC;  it should be no longer
	needed now that \makeindex is used.

2011-11-02  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	Remove specification version number from source file names.
	Introduce 'lang' into the name of the language specification files.
	* upc-lang-spec.tex: Rename from upc-specs-1-2.tex.
	* upc-lang-spec.tar.gz: Rename from upc-specs-1-2.tar.gz.
	* Makefile: Adjust file name references.
	* README.txt: Ditto.

2011-11-02  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	* Makefile: Add generated .pdf and .html_dir to list
	of files to be included in the distribution tar ball.
	Also, add ChangeLog, README.txt, and various other files
	that are part of the full source distribution.
	Build the 'dist' target by default.
	* upc-specs-1-2.tar.gz: New (binary file).  This is the
	tar ball generated by 'make dist'.
	* README.txt: add description for upc-specs-1-2.tar.gz.

2011-11-02  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-specs-1-2.tex: Use makeidx package to generate the index, and to
	avoid initial inclusion of non-existent upc-specs-1-2.ind file.

2011-11-02  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	* Makefile: Add definitions for $(RMDIR) and $(CLEAN_FILES)
	to fully implement the 'clean' target.  This works around some
	shortcomings in the latex-mk Makefile template.

2011-11-02  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	Implement changes to further support HTML generation.
	* upc-specs-1-2.tex:  Add markup and test for HTML generation.
	Replace use of math markup such as $i$ with {\tt i}
	to improve HTML readability and to simplify LaTeX usage.
	Miscellaneous corrections and improvements.
	(tab): New command to generate an approximate tab in the
	HTML output.
	(np): Modify new paragraph command to add tab character after
	paragraph number in HTML output.
	(sterm, ssterm, pterm): New commands to specify section, sub-section,
	and paragraph level terms.  Used to replace use of explicit section
	numbering and index tagging.
	(npf): First occurrences in sections of \np replaced by \npf
	"number paragraph first" directives throughout.
	* latex2html: Add improved error diagnostic that is issued
	when an unmatched HTML tag is encountered.  This is not
	strictly necessary, but does help debug problems with generated HTML.

2011-11-02  Gary Funck <gary@intrepid.com>

	Define Makefile and infrastructure for building
	both HTML and PDF versions of the UPC language specification.
	* upc-specs-1-2.tex: Renamed from upc_specs_1.2.tex.
	This form of the file name fits better with the latex-mk
	makefile infrastructure.
	* .latex2html-init: New.  latex2html configuration file
	* latex2html.cfg.pl: New. Symlink to .latex2html-init to
	provide user-visible name for the latex2html configuration file.
	Note: svn use of symlinks are not supported on Windows client.
	* latex2html: New. local copy of the latex2html script.
	* README.txt: New. Describe files in this directory.
	* Makefile: New.  Makefile.  Requires installation of 
	the 'latex-mk' package, and setting of the 'LATEX_MK_DIR'
	environment variable via /etc/profile.d/latex-mk.sh.
