\section{Scope}

\npf This document focuses only on the UPC specifications
    that extend the C Standard to an explicit parallel C based on the
    partitioned global address space model. All C specifications as per
    ISO/IEC 9899 [ISO/IEC00] are considered a part of these UPC
    specifications, and therefore will not be addressed in this
    document.

    self-containment and clarity of a subsequent UPC extension
    definition.
