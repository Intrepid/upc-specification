{\bf Synopsis} 

\npf\vspace{-2.5em}
\begin{verbatim}
    #include <upc.h>
    #include <upc_collective.h>
    void upc_all_broadcast(shared void * restrict dst, 
         shared const void * restrict src, size_t nbytes, 
         upc_flag_t flags);
\end{verbatim}

{\bf Description} 

\np The {\tt upc\_all\_broadcast} function copies a block of memory with
affinity to a single thread to a block of shared memory on each thread.
The number of bytes in each block is {\tt nbytes}.

\np{\tt nbytes} must be strictly greater than 0.

\np The {\tt upc\_all\_broadcast} function treats the {\tt src} pointer
as if it pointed to a shared memory area with the type:

\begin{verbatim}
    shared [] char[nbytes]
\end{verbatim}  

\np The effect is equivalent to copying the entire array pointed to by
{\tt src} to each block of {\tt nbytes} bytes of a shared
array {\tt dst} with the type:

\begin{verbatim}
    shared [nbytes] char[nbytes * THREADS]
\end{verbatim}  

\np The target of the {\tt dst} pointer must have affinity to
thread 0.

\np The {\tt dst} pointer is treated as if it has phase 0.

\np EXAMPLE 1 shows {\tt upc\_all\_broadcast}
\begin{verbatim}
  #include <upc.h>
  #include <upc_collective.h>
  shared int A[THREADS];
  shared int B[THREADS];
  // Initialize A.
  upc_barrier;
  upc_all_broadcast( B, &A[1], sizeof(int),
                     UPC_IN_NOSYNC | UPC_OUT_NOSYNC );
  upc_barrier;
\end{verbatim}

\np EXAMPLE 2:
\begin{verbatim}
  #include <upc.h>
  #include <upc_collective.h>
  #define NELEMS 10
  shared [] int A[NELEMS];

  upc_all_broadcast( B, A, sizeof(int)*NELEMS,
                     UPC_IN_ALLSYNC | UPC_OUT_ALLSYNC );
\end{verbatim}

\np EXAMPLE 3 shows {\tt (A[3],A[4])} is broadcast to
{\tt (B[0],B[1])}, {\tt (B[10],B[11])}, \\
{\tt (B[20],B[21])}, ..., 
{\tt (B[NELEMS*(THREADS-1)],B[NELEMS*(THREADS-1)+1])}.

{\bf Description} 

\np The {\tt upc\_all\_scatter} function copies the $i$th block of an
area of shared memory with affinity to a single thread
to a block of shared memory with affinity to the $i$th thread.
The number of bytes in each block is {\tt nbytes}.

\np{\tt nbytes} must be strictly greater than 0.

\np The {\tt upc\_all\_scatter} function treats the {\tt src} pointer
as if it pointed to a shared memory area with the type:

\begin{verbatim}
    shared [] char[nbytes * THREADS]
\end{verbatim}  

\np and it treats the {\tt dst} pointer as if it pointed to a shared
memory area with the type:

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}  

\np The target of the {\tt dst} pointer must have affinity to thread 0.

\np The {\tt dst} pointer is treated as if it has phase 0.

pointed to by {\tt dst} that has affinity to thread $i$.

\np On completion of the {\tt upc\_all\_reduce} variants,

referenced by {\tt dst} is

{\tt src[nelems-1]}
where ``$\oplus$'' is the operator specified by the variable {\tt op}.

\np On completion of the {\tt upc\_all\_prefix\_reduce} variants,

If the value of {\tt blk\_size} passed to these functions is
greater than 0 then they treat the {\tt src} pointer
as if it pointed to a shared memory area of {\tt nelems} elements of
type {\tt{\em TYPE}} and blocking factor {\tt blk\_size}, and therefore
had type:

\begin{verbatim}
    shared [blk_size] TYPE [nelems]
\end{verbatim}

\np
If the value of {\tt blk\_size} passed to these functions is
0 then they treat the {\tt src} pointer
as if it pointed to a shared memory area of {\tt nelems} elements of
type {\tt{\em TYPE}} with an indefinite layout qualifier, and
therefore had
type\footnote{Note that {\tt upc\_blocksize(src) == 0} if
{\tt src} has this type, so the argument value 0 has a natural
connection to the block size of {\tt src}.}:

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\np The phase of the {\tt src} pointer is respected when
referencing array elements, as specified above.

    equivalently to the {\tt src} pointer as described in the past 3
    paragraphs.

phase of the {\tt src} and {\tt dst} pointers to match -- ie. 
{\tt upc\_threadof(src) == upc\_threadof(dst) \&\& upc\_phaseof(src) == upc\_phaseof(dst)}.

%
% {\bf Description} 
%
%1\hspace{1em} The function prototype above represents the 11 variations of the
%{\tt upc\_all\_reduce{\em T}} function where {\tt{\em T}} and {\tt{\em TYPE}} have the
%following correspondences:
%
%\begin{center}
%\begin{tabular}{ll|ll}
%{\tt{\em T}} & {\tt{\em TYPE}} \hspace*{1.5in} &
%{\tt{\em T}} & {\tt{\em TYPE}} \\ \hline
%{\tt C} & {\tt signed char} &
%{\tt L} & {\tt signed long} \\
%{\tt UC} & {\tt unsigned char} &
%{\tt UL} & {\tt unsigned long} \\
%{\tt S} & {\tt signed short} &
%{\tt F} & {\tt float} \\
%{\tt US} & {\tt unsigned short} &
%{\tt D} & {\tt double} \\
%{\tt I} & {\tt signed int} &
%{\tt LD} & {\tt long double} \\
%{\tt UI} & {\tt unsigned int} &
%\end{tabular}
%\end{center}
%
%2\hspace{1em} For example, if {\tt{\em T}} is {\tt C}, then {\tt{\em TYPE}} must be {\tt signed char}.
%
%3\hspace{1em}
%\label{prefix-reduce-blksize-gt-0}
%If the value of {\tt blk\_size} passed to {\tt upc\_all\_prefix\_reduce{\em T}} is
%greater than 0 then
%{\tt upc\_all\_prefix\_reduce{\em T}} treats the {\tt src} pointer and the
%{\tt dst} pointer
%as if each pointed to a shared memory area of {\tt nelems} elements of
%type {\tt{\em TYPE}} and blocking factor {\tt blk\_size}, and therefore
%had type:
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%    shared [blk_size}] TYPE[nelems]
%\end{verbatim}
%
%4\hspace{1em}
%\label{prefix-reduce-blksize-0}
%If the value of {\tt blk\_size} passed to {\tt upc\_all\_prefix\_reduce{\em T}} is
%0 then \\
%{\tt upc\_all\_prefix\_reduce{\em T}} treats the {\tt src} pointer and the
%{\tt dst} pointer
%as if each pointed to a shared memory area of {\tt nelems} elements of
%type {\tt{\em TYPE}} with an indefinite layout qualifier, and
%therefore had
%type\footnote{Note that {\tt upc\_blocksize(src) == 0} if
%{\tt src} has this type, so the argument value 0 has a natural
%connection to the block size of {\tt src}.}:
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%    shared [] TYPE [nelems]
%\end{verbatim}
%
%% 1\hspace{1em} The targets of the {\tt src} and {\tt dst} pointers
%% must have affinity to thread 0.
%
%5\hspace{1em} The phases of the {\tt src} and {\tt dst} pointers are
%respected when referencing array elements, as specified in items
%\ref{prefix-reduce-blksize-gt-0} and \ref{prefix-reduce-blksize-0} above.
%
%6\hspace{1em} At function exit
%{\tt dst[i]} = {\tt src[0]} $\oplus$ {\tt src[1]}
%$\oplus \cdots \oplus$ {\tt src[i]}
%for $0 \leq$ {\tt i} $\leq$ {\tt nelems-1} and
%where ``$\oplus$'' is the operator specified by the variable {\tt op}.
%
